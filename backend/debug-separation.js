// Let's create a simple test case to understand what's happening
console.log('üìù Problem Analysis:');
console.log('1. During word placement, isWordProperlySeparated() checks for adjacent letters');
console.log('2. If a letter exists adjacent to where a word would be placed, it should reject the placement');
console.log('3. But the final grid shows adjacent words without black squares');
console.log('4. This means either:');
console.log('   a) The validation is not being called');
console.log('   b) The validation is incorrect'); 
console.log('   c) Words are being placed that pass validation but still create adjacency');
console.log('   d) Black square placement logic is wrong\n');

console.log('üîç Key Issue:');
console.log('If COLLECTED is at position (X,Y) going down');
console.log('And XIS is at position (X+9,Y) also going down (right after COLLECTED ends)');
console.log('Then during XIS placement, isWordProperlySeparated should have checked:');
console.log('- Position (X+8,Y) should be empty or blocked for proper separation');
console.log('- But COLLECTED ends at (X+8,Y) with letter "D"');
console.log('- So there IS a letter there, and the placement should have been rejected\n');

console.log('üí° Root Cause Hypothesis:');
console.log('The word separation validation is working correctly and preventing direct adjacency,');
console.log('BUT the algorithm might be failing to find good placements and then not adding');  
console.log('enough words to meet the minimum requirements, leading to a fallback that');
console.log('bypasses the strict validation.\n');

console.log('‚úÖ Diagnostic completed - Need to check if minimum requirements are being bypassed');
